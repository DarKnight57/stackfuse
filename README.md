stackfuse
=========

stackfuse is a work-in-progress fork of Cambridge, an open-source arcade stacking game. It is not intended to be clean, it is not intended to be built upon, it is not intended to be better than Cambridge. It's intended to be its own thing, with its own game modes and own assets and everything that goes along with that. If you want to actually improve the engine and contribute, please go help out the actual Cambridge project and not this. This fork is mainly a way to strive for creativity, not for improvement.

If you look at the source code, you will want to scream. You will hate it. And you know what? I don't give a damn. The sole reason this exists is to bring my mode concepts to life. There is a chance that if I ever get better at programming, I will revisit these concepts in the future.

This fork likely wouldn't be a reality without the help of the Cambridge discord. Please go check them out.

Gamemodes
----------------
* Hypertap master: Literally the very first master mode of a certain arcade series... except there is no DAS. At all. You're forced to hypertap. Enjoy the RSI.
* Powerstack: A survival-oriented gamemode where your goal is to keep your multiplier up high and extend your time limit. High score is defined by amount of levels you got.

Playing the game
----------------

Clone the repo if you really want to try this out. Windows people can just run launch.bat and other OS users can use the terminal to launch it - just point love2d to the root of the downloaded repo.

License
-------
As this fork is based on Cambridge, which is licensed under a MIT license, stackfuse is too - however I would appreciate if you wouldn't implement my own gamemodes in your own engines, unless you ask me first. I'll likely allow it if you do so. However, nothing is stopping you either.

Some code and assets in this repository are contributed by members of the
community, as well as borrowed from other places, either with licensing
or as placeholders until suitable material can be found that is properly
licensed. Their original sources, and copyright notices if applicable, are
listed in the file SOURCES. However, I will try and replace most of that stuff with my own things.
